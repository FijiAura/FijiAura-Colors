# FijiAura-Colors
This is a Reshade shader pack that can replicate color spaces. This is not really for photo editing, more to like increase saturation or smtg

***Please note that this is vibe-coded; feel free to not use if this bothers you, i mainly made it for myself.***



Currently added spaces:
- Adobe RGB
- Prophoto RGB
- scRGB, why not?
- CMYK-like
